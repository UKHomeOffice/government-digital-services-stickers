# Government Digital Services Stickers!

## Purpose
This is a repo to collect the images of the stickers people working in government digital services from all over the world make as positive propaganda! 

Stickers, the currency of government digital services. :)

## How do I add our sticker?
If you have a sticker, send a PR with a picture, photo or the sticker image itself. Give a little bit of info about it too.

## Who's crazy idea was this?
This was the badly thought out idea of Bernard Tyers. You can complain to him on Twitter using @bernardtyers.
